//For this script, only the equation is hard coded
//user is asked to specify limits and number of bins
//For the equation given, I found the following values per number of bins
//n = 10: 3357.21
//n = 50: 4231.06
//n = 100: 4154.24
//n = 500: 4078.12
//these values are compared to the actual integral result = 4078.13
//estimation is closest around 5000-10,00. After that, the numbers start diverging again
